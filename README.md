# About this project

This family tree tool is part of my worldbuilding project, the Kaleidoscope System.

Its primary purpose is to allow me to display family trees for my fictional egg-laying sapients.

If you're interested in the lore behind these families, you can find more infomation here:

You are free to adapt the family tree code for your own purposes.

However, this does *not* include the *worldbuilding concepts, art assets and my personal logo*.
Specifically excluded are the JSON files in the "config" folder, the images in the "img" subfolder and the file "style/theme_Kaleidoscope.css".
You can still use them as reference for creating your own version of these files.
